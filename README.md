# SwastikaMonitor
The Swastika Monitor is an online swastika tracking project to identify the exact locations in which swastikas have surfaced since 2000 but also various infographics that will identify who is being targeted, in what local places swastikas are most surfacing and with what accompanying texts, and what individual and community responses are emerging.
